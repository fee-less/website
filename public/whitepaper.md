# FeeLess: A Next-Generation Feeless Blockchain Protocol

## Abstract

FeeLess is a novel blockchain protocol designed to enable truly feeless transactions, rapid settlement, and a flexible token ecosystem. By replacing traditional gas fees with a minable token model, Feeless Node empowers miners to choose which tokens to mine—including custom tokens—creating new investment opportunities and giving tokens intrinsic value. By leveraging a lightweight consensus, efficient peer-to-peer networking, and a unique transaction validation model, FeeLess aims to democratize access to decentralized finance and digital assets.

## 1. Introduction

Blockchain technology has revolutionized digital value transfer, but transaction fees remain a barrier to mass adoption. Feeless Node eliminates transaction fees, allowing users to send and receive tokens without cost. Instead of gas fees, the protocol uses a minable token model, where miners can choose to mine FLSS or custom tokens, aligning incentives and enabling new forms of value creation. This whitepaper outlines the architecture, consensus, tokenomics, and security of the Feeless Node protocol.


## 2. Motivation

- **Accessibility**: Fees price out small users and microtransactions.
- **Scalability**: Traditional blockchains struggle with throughput and cost.
- **Tokenization**: Custom tokens should be as accessible as native assets.
- **Investment Opportunities**: Minable tokens allow for new investment strategies and give tokens intrinsic value, as miners can choose which tokens to support and accumulate.


## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1. Node Structure

Each Feeless Node maintains:
- A blockchain ledger (array of blocks)
- A mempool for pending transactions
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking for block and transaction propagation
- HTTP API (read only) to let applications interact with the blockchain

### 3.2. Genesis Block

The chain starts with a genesis block, distributing initial supply to a designated address.


## 4. Consensus and Mining

### 4.1. Mining

- Nodes collect mempool transactions and attempt to mine a new block.
- Mining is performed by finding a block hash below a network difficulty target.
- Each block includes:
  - 75% od all mempool transactions
  - A dev fee transaction (reward to the development wallet)
  - A mining reward transaction (reward to the miner)
- **Token Mining:** Miners can choose to mine FLSS (the native token) or custom tokens. This flexibility allows miners to support and invest in tokens they believe have value, and enables new projects to bootstrap their token economies by attracting miners.

### 4.2. Rewards

- Block rewards are split between the miner and the dev wallet (see Tokenomics for details).
- Rewards decrease over time, following a schedule to ensure scarcity and long-term value.
- **Token Rewards:** When mining custom tokens, rewards are distributed in the chosen token, incentivizing miners to participate in different token economies.

### 4.3. Feeless Transactions

- Users can send tokens without paying any transaction fee.
- The network is incentivized by block rewards, not per-transaction fees.


## 5. Transaction Model

### 5.1. Transaction Structure

Each transaction includes:
- Sender and receiver addresses (public keys)
- Amount
- Nonce (prevents replay)
- Timestamp
- Signature (secp256k1)
- Optional: Token identifier for custom tokens

### 5.2. Validation

- Transactions are validated for:
  - Correct signature
  - Sufficient balance
  - Nonce correctness
  - No double-spending (checked in mempool and blocks)
- Special handling for network transactions (rewards, airdrops)


## 6. Tokenization

- Users can mint custom tokens.
- Token minting requires a one-time fee (paid in native tokens).
- Optional airdrop: When minting, a portion can be distributed to the minter.
- **Intrinsic Value:** Since tokens can be mined and accumulated by miners, they gain intrinsic value and can be used for investment, governance, or utility within decentralized applications.


## 7. Peer-to-Peer Networking

- Nodes connect via WebSocket and HTTP.
- Blocks and transactions are propagated to peers.
- New nodes can sync from a peer by downloading all blocks.


## 8. Security

- ECDSA signatures (secp256k1) secure transactions.
- Nonce and signature uniqueness prevent replay and double-spending.
- Mempool checks prevent transaction spam from a single sender.
- Only 1 transaction per sender address is allowed in one block eliminating double spending and sustaining a floodless enviorment. 


## 9. Tokenomics

- **Total Supply:** 105,000,000 FLSS (Feeless tokens)
- **Genesis Airdrop:** 5,000,000 FLSS are airdropped to the development team at genesis to fund ongoing development and ecosystem growth.
- **Minable Supply:** 100,000,000 FLSS are distributed as mining rewards over time.
- **Dev Fee:** 7% of each block reward is allocated to the development wallet, ensuring continued support and innovation for the protocol.
- **Mining Rewards:**
  - Block rewards are emitted according to a decreasing schedule, ensuring scarcity and long-term value.
  - Miners can choose to mine FLSS or custom tokens, receiving rewards in the chosen token.
  - This model replaces traditional gas fees, aligning miner incentives with network growth and token adoption.
- **Intrinsic Value:** The ability to mine and accumulate tokens gives both FLSS and custom tokens real, market-driven value, supporting investment and utility use cases.


## 10. Use Cases

- Microtransactions and tipping
- Tokenized communities and DAOs
- NFT and digital asset transfers
- Decentralized applications requiring zero-fee UX
- **Investment:** Miners and users can invest in tokens by mining or accumulating them, supporting new projects and participating in token economies.


## 12. Conclusion

Feeless Node is a step forward in blockchain usability, removing the friction of transaction fees and enabling new applications. By aligning incentives with block rewards and supporting custom tokens, Feeless Node is positioned for broad adoption. The minable token model creates new investment opportunities and gives tokens intrinsic value, supporting a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem.
